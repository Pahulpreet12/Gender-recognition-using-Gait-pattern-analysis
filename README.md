# Gender-recognition-using-Gait-pattern-analysis
Gait is a manner of walking or stride/swing of an individual and this can be used to train models to recognize individuals or their genders. Human identification using techniques like biometric analysis based on unique behavioural or physiological characteristics has become an integral tool for human identification. Traditional biometric techniques that include fingerprint, face, iris etc. have some major disadvantages. They cannot work on low resolution images or images taken from a distance. It also requires the complete cooperation by the user to give satisfactory results. This is, in some cases obtrusive and in others completely impossible like preliminary analysis of a crime scene etc. Analysis of gait patterns can overcome these drawbacks and hence, it has attracted attention from the computer vision experts in recent years.
